# 🧮 Scientific Calculator – Universal Math Engine

A **next‑generation scientific calculator & interactive math solver** designed to handle **everything from Grade 1 basics to advanced engineering mathematics** — all in one platform.

This project is built with a **vibe‑coder mindset**: clean architecture, scalable APIs, and future‑ready design, aiming to feel more like a **math lab** than a traditional calculator.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Traditional calculators only give answers.

**This project aims to:**

* Solve problems ✔️
* Explain concepts ✔️
* Visualize mathematics ✔️
* Scale from school to engineering ✔️

The long‑term goal is to build a **universal math engine** that students, teachers, and engineers can rely on.

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

Follow these simple steps to run the scientific calculator locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilnarayan419-ui/Scientific-calculator.git
cd Scientific-calculator
````

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

* **Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Linux / macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ℹ️ If `requirements.txt` is not present yet, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy sympy scipy
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Calculator

```bash
python calculator.py
```

### 5️⃣ Start Exploring 🎉

* Enter numbers and operations as prompted
* Modify or extend the code to add new math topics
* Use this as a base for APIs or a web interface later
